what do you mean by unicode format?

See http://unicode.org/ for far more than you probably want to know.

Unicode is a standard which defines the internal text coding system in almost all current operating systems used
in computers, whether Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Solaris Unix or whatever, because it can handle characters for almost
 all modern languages and even some ancient languages at the same time, as long as the user has fonts for the particular
  language installed.

It is the most commonly used character code on the Internet.

(See http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/ for various free or low-cost Unicode fonts and Unicode resources.)

You don’t say what application you are using to write your article. But if it comes up with a message warning you that
 you need to save in Unicode, then it is probably an editor or word processor that can handle Unicode, but which you
  have set to save in an older character set.

Possibly, when you saved it anyhow, it did save in Unicode format. Or it may have saved in the older format , in which
 case some of your characters that cannot be handled in that older format (dashes or curly quotation marks perhaps) will
  have been converted, probably to question marks.

I suggest you set your application to save in a Unicode-compatible format. Most Word processors (MS Word,
OpenOffice Writer and so forth already save in a Unicode-compatible format.) But if you save as text, at least
under Windows, the application will attempt to save in your standard Windows 8-bit character set, not in Unicode.
You need to save as “Text Encoded” or “Encoded Text” which will allow you to select what coding you wish to save your
file in.

Select “Unicode” or “UTF-16” or “UTF-8” or something similar.
